# streamlit-to-heroku-Churn
She Code Africa Final Project
Our aim in this project was to develop a churn prediction model using machine learning algorithms. I deployed my model into production using Streamlit which is a popular open-source framework and the simplest way of building web applications and deploying machine learning models. For the functionality of my application, I deployed my Streamlit app to Heroku. To see my model in the production stage, check https://churn-customer-predictor.herokuapp.com/
